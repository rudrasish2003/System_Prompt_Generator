Candidate￾Candidate- Hello.
Yes, my name is Mercy, Am I speaking with Rose?
Yes
Hey Rose, I'm calling you from Ancile services. You applied for a FedEx delivery driver's job 
with (Contractor company Name).
Yes.
Is it a good time to talk?
Candidate-Yeah.
OK. Can you brief me about your driving experiences? Have you worked with FedEx before?
Candidate- No, I've never worked for FedEx, but I've been a tow driver for the last five years 
of picking up and delivering and doing stuff like that. I've done it for the last five years.
Last five years, are you still working?
Candidate - Kind of sort of. I mean, I work for the company, but we're going out of business. 
So it's like there is no work, but I'm still doing their dispatching and stuff like that.
OK, alright. And that is why you're looking for a change?
Candidate- Yes, well, they havent paid me since February.
Oh, OK alright, got it. So, any other experience apart from this or is the only experience as a 
driver as i do not see anything else on your resume as well?
Candidate- I used to deliver pizza when I was 16. 
OK, alright. Would you be able to provide a reference for that job?
Candidate -Oh, that was 30 years ago. That company, no longer in the distance.
OK, alright. In that case, this is enough. The towing company would be enough. It's OK now. 
Do you have a DoT medical card?
OK.
Candidate-No.
OK, no problem. The contractor will help get you 1 and it's going. To be free of cost.
Candidate-OK.
Now would you be able to pass a background verification check or a drug test or a physical 
test?
Candidate- Oh yeah.
OK, alright. And can you confirm that you're above the age of 21?
Candidate- Yes. I'm 46.
Alright. So Rose, I'm sending you the terminal address over text. I want you to check and 
tell me how far it is from your place of residence? 
Candidate- The terminal is a 15min. drive for me.
OK, alright.
OK. All right. Do you have a reliable means of transport like your own car or something?
Candidate- Yes.
OK, alright. OK, Rose, those are all the questions that I had for you. Now I will walk you
through the job description, if you have any questions in between, you can stop me, and I'll 
clarify that for you, OK?
So, the routes are going to be business and residential. The area that you will be covering is 
Pico Rivera and Montebello. Are you aware of these areas?
Candidate- Not entirely, but i guess i will be using navigation?
Yes.
OK, alright. Now your shift will start at 8:30 in the morning. It's going to be an 8-hour shift 
and you'll be driving about 40 miles per day. About your shift hours, if you're able to 
successfully deliver all packages before 8 hours, you are free to go home. You will be paid 
for the whole day but, just in case If you are unable to, then you must extend to make sure 
that the packages are delivered.
Candidate- okay.
The contractor is operational seven days a week, but you will be working for five days,
which will include a weekend as a mandate. Are you comfortable working on weekends?
Candidate – can i choose the weekends?
No, but you can definitely have a discussion when you go for the final interview.
Candidate- Okay, that works.
Right now, you're basically going to do 150 stops per day. That is the threshold. If you're 
able to surpass the threshold, then you're getting $1.00 extra for any additional stops that 
you make.
OK.
The packages can weigh up to 150 lbs but for assistance you will have a dolly.
Candidate- OK, I'm not worried about that. I can look that up. 
Alright. So moving forward to your pay, your pay is going to be initially $18.00 an hour, but it 
can go all the way up to $20 per hour based on your experience. Are you comfortable with 
the pay?
Candidate- Yes, that sounds good.
Okay, your payday is going to be on Friday every week. Once you complete 60 days with the
company, you get 3 days of sick leave.
Also,If you are working for more than 40 hours a week, then you're entitled to overtime. And 
you have other benefits such as 401K.
Candidate -That's perfect.
All right. And lastly, you're going to drive. P700 to P1200 trucks, are you familiar with them?
Candidate-OK. Yes straight trucks.
Yeah.
OK, that is all for the job description. Do you have any? Questions for me?
Candidate -Pay period. Is it? Do you guys make direct deposits?
Yes, that would be a direct deposit.
Candidate-OK. Oh, OK. OK. So that's the question i had.
See, once you go through. Yes, yes, yes, I understand. So that is what I was saying that 
once you go through all the steps in order to be hired, once you go for the phase two phase 
interview with the contractor, you can clear out all the other doubts that you have.
OK.
Alright, so like, are you OK with this? Do you want to go forward with the process?
